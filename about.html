    <h1>About Succotash</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
            <p>Succotash began with a simple observation. One day, my wife lined up our little tomatoes on the counter, I snapped a photo and <a href="https://njump.me/nevent1qqsvhxvnefjqwr95mlj4qumrrwukt8uzept6aazssnje8psqhg09ptszyqq9h3x7g88ukkq0w89ddt5fpx5hv45xxwj0d2fuddlat0l0z8s6yl7mgmq" target="_blank">put it on Nostr</a>. This simple note sparked something unexpected.</p>
            
            <p>The Nostr note was auto-bridged <a href="https://hive.blog/hive-124838/@crrdlx/hostr-snaps-9i13ooa7ufp" target="_blank">over to Hive</a> where a Hiver suggested it looked like a game. That was enough to get my creative juices flowing. The round tomatoes nestled in the tile grooves reminded me of Chinese checkers, while the grid brought to mind Hex - the game John Nash played. I wondered if a square-grid version might be viable.</p>
            
            <p>After some research, I discovered that Hex is part of a family of "Connection games," including one called Tak that seemed particularly interesting and simple. I like interesting, and I really like simple.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>The Game Takes Shape</h2>
            <p>While a square grid connection game wasn't new, I wanted something that could be played with everyday items. Tak requires stacking "stones" or standing them on edge, which wouldn't work with tomatoes. Then I noticed some dried corn kernels and beans nearby...</p>
            
            <p>I drew out a 5 x 5 grid of dots, lined up five corn kernels on one side in a "home row" and 5 beans on the other. Remembering a game where two sides of Army men met after a series of moves, I wanted to incorporate some type of combat or conquest. So I started experimenting, moving kernels and beans, and the game began to take shape. I <a href="https://hive.blog/games/@crrdlx/introducing-succotash-the-game" target="_blank">announced Succotash</a> on Hive. After some suggestions in the comments, I began to build the online version. Truth be told, I still prefer the real corn and bean on paper version.</p>

        <div class="rules-section">
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>This is a person-vs-person game. The objective is to connect one side (your home row) to your opponent's side. The connection can be a straight line or include diagonal paths.</p>
            
            <h3>Basic Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Two players take turns moving one piece at a time</li>
                <li>Movement is limited to one spot forward/back or sideways (NSEW)</li>
                <li>Opponents can occupy the same spot ("co-squatting")</li>
                <li>Combat occurs when a piece moves to a spot with an opponent</li>
                <li>Conquest happens when one side outnumbers the other 2-to-1</li>
                <li>Conquered pieces return to their home row</li>
                <li>First to connect their home row to the opposite side wins</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Why "Succotash"?</h2>
            <p>Initially, I wanted a tomato-themed name, but since we were using corn and beans, "Succotash" seemed perfect - it's a dish that combines corn, beans, and vegetables. I considered "Texas Caviar Game" (since it has tomatoes), but "Succotash" just sounds better. Plus, adding tomatoes to succotash sounds delicious!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Keeping It Simple</h2>
            <p>A big goal was to keep the game simple. All you need is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A paper with a 5 x 5 grid drawn on it</li>
                <li>5 pieces of something and 5 pieces of something else</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While I used corn kernels and beans, you could easily use shells/legos, pennies/paperclips, nuts/stones, or whatever you have handy.</p>
